# Cancelled Projects

Repository to store all my cancelled projects that I believe is worth showing

## Extraction Shooter

Did a project working on a video game solo for 12 months in Unreal Engine 5 that I decided to cancel development for at the 12 month mark, I decided to upload the code for the game here.

## DuckRun

Wanted to try out mobile development so I decided to make an android game in Unity, my aim with this was to make something that is fun, infinitely replayable and easy for anyone to pick up and understand how to play. I decided to drop this game because I felt the gameplay was too simple and lacked depth.
