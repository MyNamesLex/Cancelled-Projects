# DuckRun

#### Description:
Wanted to try out mobile development so I decided to make an android game in Unity, my aim with this was to make something that is fun, infinitely replayable and easy for anyone to pick up and understand how to play. I decided to drop this game because I felt the gameplay was too simple and lacked depth. 

I attempted to add more depth by adding in customisation options that can be unlocked using the in game currency, however I disabled the game actually using this in game currency for testing reasons and it just lets you purchase it without checking or subtracting any in game currency. The in game currency is gained through how well you do in the game but this didn't feel sufficient enough to add the needed depth. These customisation options were, new cat skins, new player skins, new bird skins and new background skins.
